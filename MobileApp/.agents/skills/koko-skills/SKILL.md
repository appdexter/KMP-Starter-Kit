description: Reference index for all available development skills in the Koko (KMPStarterKit) monorepo. Use when working in the MobileApp/ directory to discover step-by-step guides for adding screens, Room entities, preferences, permissions, and building or publishing the app.

# Koko (KMPStarterKit) Agent Skills Index

When working inside the `MobileApp/` Android Studio window, you are isolated from the root directory context. However, a comprehensive suite of development skills exists one level up in the parent directory (`../skills/`). 

This index provides you with the name, location, and exact description of every skill available in the project so you can reference and execute them directly.

---

## Accessing Skills
To use any of these skills, read the corresponding `SKILL.md` file using your file-reading tool.
The skills live in the **`skills/` directory at the repository root** — one level above `MobileApp/`.
The links below are written relative to this file.

---

## 🛠️ Environment Setup (first time)

- Open the `MobileApp/` directory in its own Android Studio window.
- Verify the **Kotlin** and **Kotlin Multiplatform** plugins are installed and up to date
  (`Settings` → `Plugins`) — required for Compose Multiplatform previews and KMP sync.
- Then use the index below. Run any `./gradlew` / `./scripts/` command from the `MobileApp/` directory.
