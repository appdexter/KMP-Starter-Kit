# Koko Monorepo: Getting Started

Welcome to the KMP Contest Starter Kit Monorepo (nicknamed Koko). This project is organized into multiple specialized sub-projects to separate concerns between mobile application development (`MobileApp`) and backend/web services in support of the mobile application (`Web`).

## 🛠️ Development Workflow: The Two-Window Approach

To work effectively with this monorepo, we recommend the Two-Window Approach in Android Studio:

1. **Window 1 (this window): Orchestration & Web**
    * **Purpose**: Managing the monorepo, running orchestration skills, managing the supporting Web app (e.g., that serves as a service layer for the mobile apps including securely handling API Keys), and managing Firebase services.
    * **Features**: Command-line tools, Firebase CLI, and backend configuration.

2. **Window 2 (new window): Mobile Application (`MobileApp/`)**
    * **Purpose**: Active development of the Kotlin Multiplatform app.
    * **Features**: Compose Previews, Android/iOS/Desktop/Web targets, and mobile-specific debugging.
    * **Getting Started**: Open the `MobileApp/` directory in a new Android Studio window and type `Proceed with @koko-mobileapp-getting-started` into the agent's chat panel to begin the Phase 1 developer journey guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTION**: Whenever a developer says `please proceed with @koko-getting-started`, "getting started", or asks to start Phase 1, the agent's very first step and response MUST explicitly instruct the developer to open a new Android Studio window for the `MobileApp/` directory. The agent must state this clearly:
> *"Our first step involves opening up a new Android Studio window for the MobileApp directory, so we can utilize the Two-Window Approach. Please open the `MobileApp/` directory (at the repository root) in a new window and type `Proceed with @koko-mobileapp-getting-started` into the agent's chat panel there to get the mobile environment loaded!"*

## 🚀 Skill Discovery

This monorepo uses skills in the root level `skills` directory. A summary of available skills can be found by activating the `koko-skills` skill in the `MobileApp` directory. 

### 📱 Mobile Development
For all mobile-specific tasks (UI, Data, Navigation, Monetization, etc.), use the `MobileApp/` window and load the specific skill you need. The phase 1 developer journey is managed via:
- [**koko-mobileapp-getting-started**](../../../MobileApp/.agents/skills/koko-mobileapp-getting-started/SKILL.md)

### 🌐 Web & Backend
Once the KMP app is ready (the getting started skill mentioned above is complete), start working on the `integrations` skill in this window to complete tasks related to Firebase Hosting, Cloud Functions, etc. 
- [**integrations**](../../../skills/integrations/SKILL.md)
